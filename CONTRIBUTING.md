Thanks for your interest in contributing! The basic workflow is to fork and send
a pull request. Unless you explicitly state otherwise, the act of sending a pull
request is a statement that the work is yours (original) and that you provide it
under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

There is not a mailing list. You should be able to discover work-in-progress
(and thus, avoid repeated effort) by searching the issue tracker or the list of
currently open pull requests.
