Thanks for your interest in contributing! The basic workflow is to fork and send
a pull request. Unless you explicitly state otherwise, the act of sending a pull
request is a statement that the work is yours (original) and that you provide it
under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Note that this is implied by the [GitHub Terms of Service](
https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license).

There is not a mailing list. You should be able to discover work-in-progress
(and thus, avoid repeated effort) by searching [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/fmrchallenge/tlzoo/issues) or the list of currently
open [pull requests](https://github.com/fmrchallenge/tlzoo/pulls).
