The Specification Language Zoo
------------------------------

The ambition of this repository is to concisely document all specification
languages and their relationships as presented in published papers. It aspires
to be a comprehensive listing of specification languages that have been
described in the literature, along with salient results and properties, e.g.,
computational complexity and expressiveness relative to other specification
languages. Each listing must have the first (known) paper that introduced the
specification language, and it must have citations for each property, where
readers can find proofs etc.

The scope for inclusion is potential applicability in robotics and, in general,
hybrid systems. Note that specification languages developed for concurrent
systems and other settings classically treated in the formal verification
literature are still in scope.


Organization
------------

There are two main parts to this repository: the collection of YAML files that
stores all data about specification languages, and scripts for deploying a
website that hosts search-able access to these data.
