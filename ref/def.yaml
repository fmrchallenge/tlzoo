## NOTES:
##
## The canonical name (key `name`) should be the name most widely used
## in the literature.  Because this may be difficult to assess
## reliably for a given specification language, it is also acceptable
## to use an abbreviation that is easily (arguably) recognized.
##
## The first alias, if it exists, is used as the verbose form of the
## specification language. E.g., the entry for LTL has `name: LTL` and
## the first item in its `alias` list is `linear-time temporal logic`.
## Thus, it is rendered in the website as LTL (linear-time temporal logic).

  summary: GR(1) specifications define 2-player games with transition
    requirements (safety) and liveness conditions assigned to each player. If
    the adversary satisfies its liveness conditions, then the controlled player
    must satify its liveness conditions. In terms of temporal operators, the
    canonical pattern for GR(1) is
    $$ \bigwedge\square\Diamond \implies \bigwedge\square\Diamond$$
    where the implication has a special interpretation to ensure causal controllers.
