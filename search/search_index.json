It aspires to be a comprehensive listing of specification languages that have been described in the literature, along with salient results and properties, e.g., computational complexity and expressiveness relative to other specification languages. Each listing must have the first (known) paper that introduced the specification language, and it must have citations for each property, where readers can find proofs etc. The scope for inclusion is potential applicability in robotics and, in general, hybrid systems. Note that specification languages developed for concurrent systems and other settings classically treated in the formal verification literature are still in scope. Organization There are two main parts to this repository: the collection of YAML files that stores all data about specification languages, and scripts for deploying a website that hosts search-able access to these data. Building the site is described below. Note that contributing new entries does not require capability to build and deploy the website. Participating To report errors, to propose changes to existing entries, or to suggest the addition of new material, please use the issue tracker at https://github.com/fmrchallenge/tlzoo/issues . More details about contributing material are in contributing . Building the website Python is required. Everything in known to work on GNU/Linux. Testers and contributors for other platforms are welcome! The primary dependencies are PyYAML , MkDocs , and the mdx_math extension for Python-Markdown . To install them, try pip install pyyaml mkdocs python-markdown-math Now, to build the website content, ./build.sh The output will be placed under the directory site/site/.
